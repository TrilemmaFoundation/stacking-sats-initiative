## 🧩 Problem Statement

As individuals, institutions, and even nations race to accumulate a mathematically scarce asset, we ask: **How can we do better than dollar-cost averaging (DCA)?** If Bitcoin is good, we want more of it. And yes — there are systematic, data-driven strategies that consistently yield more Bitcoin per dollar than DCA.  

> To find this initiative useful, you must first believe that accumulating Bitcoin is worthwhile.  
> If not, suppose — *for the sake of contradiction* — that it is. Then continue reading.  
>
> *“If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry”.*  
> — **Satoshi Nakamoto**

Designing optimal Bitcoin accumulation strategies should be a rigorous generalization of dollar-cost averaging. Without rigor, it's easy to produce degenerate strategies that lack statistical significance. So, we have defined a framework that constrains the space of valid solutions to reduce overfitting and eliminate spurious models. However, the resulting search space remains mathematically vast and difficult to navigate. This is why we have open-sourced the challenge — to invite technical talent around the world to contribute to a real-world Bitcoin quant problem.
